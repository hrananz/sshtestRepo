nano -w /etc/yum.repos.d/dag.repo

Insert
<pre>
[dag]
name=Dag RPM Repository for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
baseurl=http://apt.sw.be/redhat/el$releasever/en/$basearch/dag
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
</pre>

do yum update if you want or do following:

  yum search ffmpeg
  yum install ffmpeg

if you get an error of following sort:

<pre>
Public key for imlib2-1.2.2-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm is not installed
[root@localhost home]#
</pre>

Then you will need to do following:

<pre>
rpm -Uhv http://apt.sw.be/redhat/el5/en/x86_64/rpmforge/RPMS//rpmforge-release-0.3.6-1.el5.rf.x86_64.rpm
</pre>

This will set up the rpmforge repos on that vps / server.  Then you will be able to do the yum install ffmpeg*

Note:  You should install the ffmpeg source files too as these will be used to compile php-ffmpeg

Next
----
Download ffmpeg-php from http://ffmpeg-php.sourceforge.net/

Use the instructions there to compile the ffmpeg.so binary which then you will need to put in your php.ini as per the instructions there.

restart apache and way she goes.
